# New Database Table

For the new table, Don created a migration to create a table named blockchain. Kaelen took the migration file and deployed it to his database on the live CodeBoxx Amazon server in the database named KaelenBurroughs. The database table is updated through Kaelen's REST API, found at: https://rest-api-burroughs.herokuapp.com, and the code can be seen at the private repo here: https://github.com/ACLTearr/Rest-API-Rocket-Elevators.git. There were 5 endpoints added. One endpoint to post to the database for each contract, and one endpoint to get all of the contracts of a given project name.
